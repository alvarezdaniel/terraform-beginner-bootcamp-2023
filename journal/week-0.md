### Building the bridge as we cross it

- not everything is prepared ahead of time
- project and feature scope may change
- we may need to circle back and repeat things
- we may [out of order] do things
- we made add content ad-hoc to address unexpected scenarios
- **technical failure is possible**
- we may need to circle back and repeat things

### This is **NOT** a paint by numbers Bootcamp

- you **cannot** just follow steps and complete

- you need show **Proof of Effort** when asking questions

### Honing the craft, not just the tool

- we are going to do **non-terraform things**

- we are going to **explore technical specs**
- we are going to **google/bing things**
